# Webscraper-Intern-Plus
Comission on 20/08/2022
1. It can now scrape the doctor's name, address, telephone number, and user webpage, which is outputted to a text file (out.txt)
2. If you want to change the profession or you want a different location then you can just change the values of the state, city, and field variables
3. **Make sure to delete all of the past content in the out.txt file so that the stuff you scrape now won't stack on top of the previous stuff**

*The program will proceed to pause for 6 seconds in between scrapes in order to properly follow ethical webscraping guidelines (according to some page I read online)*
